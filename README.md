## This Repo contains all the files necessary for the development and deployment of this Project.

This repository contains a link to a unique Dataset created to Simultaneously Detect Age, Gender and Attire in the wild.
It also contains many code-snippets I have written over the years to help with data-wrangling and combing. 
Please feel free to raise any issue and to reach out.
